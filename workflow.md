# Todoist

**Background.** I am a professor with a lot of duties. In addition to 
the usual teaching, research, and service expected of all professors at
research universities, I am an editor of a journal with one of the highest
submission rates in the field and the director of graduate studies in a
department with MA and PhD programs. I recently chaired a faculty search
committee. This puts me in the "very busy" category.

I struggled mightily in the first few months after starting my role as
director of graduate studies. The problem was that I had things coming
at me all the time:

- I needed to take care of many things at certain times throughout the
    year. Graduate admissions, assignment of GTA duties, and an endless
    stream of other things that always seemed to pop up.
- Constant requests for information. Many of these requests were related
    to grad school admissions (I would never have believed the volume of
    inquiries prior to taking the position - we have a very popular
    graduate program!)
- Student/faculty issues that had to be taken care of. Each of these is
    different, and they often require research.
- A steady stream of issues for papers I'm handling for the journal.
- Graduate student advising.
- The usual things that come up when you're teaching two classes.
- All the things that have to be handled when running a faculty search.
- Coauthors sending research results and needing additional results/information.

Most of this came at me in the form of a never ending stream of email.
The sheer volume of messages that needed a thoughtful reply exposed the
many holes in what was a management system that had previously worked
well. It felt like I was in the middle of the ocean in a boat that had
holes in it. No matter how hard I worked to plug the holes, there were
always more.

I needed a system that would help me get everything under control, one
that worked well with email, but that did a lot more than organize my
email messages. I don't plan to go into any detail here about the system
I had been using, because there are always people who use such a system
and they find that it works well. I'm happy for them, but I have no
interest in engaging in a debate about it.

**Taming the email beast.** I found a good solution in Todoist. It's not
perfect, but it works well enough to keep me sane.

I can get to inbox zero. I make decisions on all email messages. Is there
an action associated with the email? If so, forward it to Todoist. Add it
to the correct project with a due date. It'll automatically end up on my
schedule, and I'll get an email reminder in advance. That was the most
important step. I basically had an assistant that tracked *all* of my
commitments and I could trust that it wouldn't let me forget any of them.

**Dead simple review.** Not everything that needs to be revisited at some
point in the future comes with a due date. For instance, I should periodically
check that I don't have any overdue library books. For that, I make a
task with the `@review` label. When I'm ready to do a comprehensive review,
I just pull up everything with a `@review` label.

**Subtasks and subprojects.** Todoist has good support for subtasks and
subprojects. For example, I can create a project for graduate admissions
with a task for each student, and subtasks for my interactions with the
students.

**Attachments.** A majority of the tasks I have to do have associated
reference material. There might be related files. I might want to jot
down a comment to remind me of something to include in a response. Every
task has its own email address. Messages forwarded to that address are
automatically attached as reference material. If there are attachments
to the email, such as a spreadsheet or a PDF file, the attachments are 
automatically added as their own files.

These are just the most important features. I'm still learning to use
the features of Todoist.

Although Todoist has a free version, it's not too useful, so you should
plan to get a premium or business plan. If you're an educator or student,
you can get a 70% discount on Todoist Business - just $18 a year. That is
an incredible value, and if you want, you can add others to your projects,
even if they don't have a Todoist Business plan.
